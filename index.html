<h1>🏎️ Formula 1 Where speed meets strategy</h1>
<h2>It rocks!</h2>
<p>. Every race is a high-stakes ballet of precision engineering, fearless driving, and split-second decisions. From the roar of the engines to the drama in the pit lane, F1 is more than a sport—it's a global obsession fueled by adrenaline and innovation.</p>

<h2>🏎️ The Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li>F1 is a racing sport with very fast, high-tech cars.</li>
<li>Each car has one seat and open wheels (you can see them).</li>
<li>Races happen all over the world on special tracks called circuits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>👥 Teams & Drivers</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are 10 teams, like Ferrari, Red Bull, and Mercedes etc</li>
<li>Each team has 2 drivers, so 20 drivers race in total.</li>
<li>Drivers and teams earn points based on how well they finish each race.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🏁 The Races</h2
<ul>
<li>Each race is called a Grand Prix.</li>
<li>There are around 24 races in a season.</li>
<li>The goal is to win the Drivers' Championship (for the best driver) and the Constructors' Championship (for the best team).</li>
</ul>
<h2>⚙️ The Cars</h2>
<ul>
<li>F1 cars are super fast—they can go over 300 km/h.</li>
<li>They use hybrid engines (gas + electric).</li>
<li>Every part of the car is designed for speed, safety, and control.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🧠 Strategy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Teams plan when to change tires, how much fuel to use, and how to react to weather or crashes. </li>
<li>Races aren’t just about speed—they’re about smart decisions too.</li>
</ul>
<h2> Tire Strategy</h2>
<ol>
<li>F1 races require drivers to use at least two different tire types (soft, medium, hard).</li>
<li>Teams choose tires based on track conditions, weather, and durability.</li>
<li>Softer tires are faster but wear out quickly; harder tires last longer but are slower.</li>
</ol>
<h2>🕒 Pit Stop Timing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pit stops are used to change tires and make quick adjustments.</li>
<li>Timing is crucial—pitting too early or too late can cost positions.</li>
<li>Teams often react to rivals’ pit stops to gain an advantage.</li>
</ul>
